It is time for you to start using a modern Album Photo Gallery - XenForo Gallery. With nice layout and modern functions, you would make your users happy.

So what does this addon provide you:
	- Create albums with photos and videos.
	- Set custom privacy for Albums/Photos wherever who could view/comment on your Albums and Photos. For Albums you could set who can add photos to your albums. You also can set who has permission to download the original photos of the album.
	- Built in with default album type: Profile Album and Mobile Upload Album (depends on whatever you are online on).
	- Photo tagging with facebook-like styles. User could set privacy in their account to allow who can tag them and they would be asked for confirmation each time they get tagged or they could enable direct tagging that do not ask for their confirmation.
	- User could set default privacy values for new albums and photos.
	- NewsFeed if someone posted new albums/photos/comments or was tagged.
	- Alert system ready.
	- Photo Exif ready. Auto read photo's exif data (if available). Exif data would be shown in photo view with some detail information: Camera model/Location/Focal Length/ISO speed... you could see all important exif data by click on detail information as you could see in Flickr. (This function require exif extension to be enabled).
	- Album list and photo list are auto grid and auto load new pages so just scroll down to see more item, no more manual click on pages. (You could enable regular page selecting from Style Properties).
	- Photos with same location would be available on that specific location page
	- Photos with same camera would be available on that specific camera page with some camera's information.
	- Limitation per usergroup (File size, album count, photo count in a album, new albums/photos/comments would be moderated or not...).
	- Streaming System (Another name of Tag as it might confused from photo people tagging).
	- Collection System: A set of photos or albums that would be promoted by your staffs.
	- Widget (Widget Frameworks) is ready for comments, photos and albums.
