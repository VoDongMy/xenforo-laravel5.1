1. During the installation, you get: An exception occurred: Mysqli prepare error: MySQL server has gone away
	- You might want to increase "max_allowed_packet" setting in your mysql setting (my.conf). 
	During the installation, it would import camera data so this value need a little higher.
	
2. How could I change the grid size? It leaves some blank area on my Album list and Album view.
	- You need to change Grid's width to match your style's width. Please go to Style Properties => sonnb - XenGallery - Grid Layout
	
3. After my threads/old gallerys were imported. I cannot see them, where are they?
	- It is required to rebuild Albums and Contents to re-caculate information after importing. Please go to: AdminCP -> Tools -> Rebuild Caches. Find Rebuild Albums and Rebuild Contents.
	
4. More questions or bug report?
